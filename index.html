			<div id="slideshow" class="slideshow">
				<div class="slide">
					<h2 class="slide__title slide__title--preview">Use Recall <span class="slide__price">#1</span></h2>
					<div class="slide__item">
						<div class="slide__inner">
							<p>After you read a page, look away and recall the main ideas. Highlight very little, and never highlight anything you haven’t put in your mind first by recalling. Try recalling main ideas when you are walking to class or in a different room from where you originally learned it. An ability to recall—to generate the ideas from inside yourself—is one of the key indicators of good learning.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="slide">
					<h2 class="slide__title slide__title--preview">Test yourself <span class="slide__price">#2</span></h2>
					<div class="slide__item">
						<div class="slide__inner">
							<p>On everything. All the time. Flash cards are your friend. To study most effectively, handwrite (don’t type) a problem on one side of a flash card and the solution on the other. (Handwriting builds stronger neural structures in memory than typing.)</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="slide">
					<h2 class="slide__title slide__title--preview">Chunk your problems <span class="slide__price">#3</span></h2>
					<div class="slide__item">
						<div class="slide__inner">
							<p>Chunking is understanding and practicing with a problem solution so that it can all come to mind in a flash. After you solve a problem, rehearse it. Make sure you can solve it cold—every step. Pretend it’s a song and learn to play it over and over again in your mind, so the information combines into one smooth chunk you can pull up whenever you want.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="slide">
					<h2 class="slide__title slide__title--preview">Space your repetition <span class="slide__price">#4</span></h2>
					<div class="slide__item">
						<div class="slide__inner">
							<p>Spread out your learning in any subject a little every day, just like an athlete. Your brain is like a muscle—it can handle only a limited amount of exercise on one subject at a time.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="slide">
					<h2 class="slide__title slide__title--preview">Alternate different problem-solving techniques during your practice <span class="slide__price">#5</span></h2>
					<div class="slide__item">
						<div class="slide__inner">
							<p>Never practice too long at any one session using only one problem-solving technique—after a while. Mix it up and work on different types of problems. (Books generally are not set up this way, so you’ll need to do this on your own.) After every assignment and test, go over your errors, make sure you understand why you made them, and then rework your solutions. Another way to do this is to randomly flip through your book, pick out a problem, and see whether you can solve it cold.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="slide">
					<h2 class="slide__title slide__title--preview">Take breaks <span class="slide__price">#6</span></h2>
					<div class="slide__item">
						<div class="slide__inner">
							<p> It is common to be unable to solve problems or figure out concepts in math or science the first time you encounter them. This is why a little study every day is much better than a lot of studying all at once. When you get frustrated with a math or science problem, take a break so that another part of your mind can take over and work in the background.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="slide">
					<h2 class="slide__title slide__title--preview">Use explanatory questioning and simple analogies <span class="slide__price">#7</span></h2>
					<div class="slide__item">
						<div class="slide__inner">
							<p>Whenever you are struggling with a concept, think to yourself, How can I explain this so that a ten-year-old could understand it? Using an analogy really helps, like saying that the flow of electricity is like the flow of water. Don’t just think your explanation—say it out loud or put it in writing. The additional effort of speaking and writing allows you to more deeply encode (that is, convert into neural memory structures) what you are learning.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="slide">
					<h2 class="slide__title slide__title--preview">Focus <span class="slide__price">#8</span></h2>
					<div class="slide__item">
						<div class="slide__inner">
							<p>Turn off all interrupting beeps and alarms on your phone and computer, and then turn on a timer for twenty-five minutes. Focus intently for those twenty-five minutes and try to work as diligently as you can. After the timer goes off, give yourself a small, fun reward. A few of these sessions in a day can really move your studies forward. Try to set up times and places where studying—not glancing at your computer or phone—is just something you naturally do.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="slide">
					<h2 class="slide__title slide__title--preview">Eat your frogs first <span class="slide__price">#9</span></h2>
					<div class="slide__item">
						<div class="slide__inner">
							<p>Do the hardest thing earliest in the day, when you are fresh.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="slide">
					<h2 class="slide__title slide__title--preview">Make a mental contrast <span class="slide__price">#10</span></h2>
					<div class="slide__item">
						<div class="slide__inner">
							<p>Imagine where you’ve come from and contrast that with the dream of where your studies will take you. Post a picture or words in your workspace to remind you of your dream. Look at that when you find your motivation lagging. This work will pay off both for you and those you love!</p>
